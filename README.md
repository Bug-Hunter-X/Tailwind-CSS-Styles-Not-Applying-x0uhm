# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply styles correctly to an element. The issue is resolved by ensuring the Tailwind configuration is properly set up and there are no conflicting styles or missing dependencies.

## Bug Description

A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes for background color, padding, rounded corners, and shadow is not rendering these styles as expected.  This occurs despite the classes seeming correctly defined within the Tailwind configuration.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the development server (instructions may vary based on your setup).
4. Observe the rendered HTML; the div will not display the expected Tailwind styles.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Tailwind configuration and ensuring no conflicting styles are present, along with checking for any missing dependencies.
